This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common bug in TypeScript involving type safety within arrays.  The `printAllNumbers` function is designed to handle an array of numbers; however, it silently accepts an array containing a mixture of numbers and strings, only throwing an error during runtime. This showcases the limitations of TypeScript's type checking when dealing with inconsistent data within arrays.  The solution provides a way to enhance the type safety of the function.
